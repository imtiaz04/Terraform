whenever we do terraform init ,plugins are installed
whenever we do terraform plan, the execution plan is generated.
whenever we do terraform apply, the execution is done & state is mentioned

if, we dont have state we can still run the above commands, but state is useful to keep a record of why & how infrastucrure was created at the first place

State is like a blueprint of the Real world infrastucture with some unique ids and attributes


used to improve performance dependancy management,etc....
